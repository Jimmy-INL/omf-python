## Overview

When attempting to overcome challenges alone, the obstacles can seem
monumental. When approached together, however, anything is possible.

The Global Mining Guidelines Group (GMG) is a community of mining
companies, OEMs, OTMs, research organizations, and consultants
from around the world who recognize that innovation does not
happen in silos. Together, this diverse community addresses
common challenges and creates tangible deliverables,
enabling a productive, safe, and sustainable future for mining.

A diverse community brings diverse ideas and perspectives to complex
problems; this is paramount to the success of any open source project,
including OMF. However, conflicting viewpoints and disagreement can
quickly escalate into harassment and aggression when amplified by
misunderstanding, miscommunication, and taking disagreement personally.

## Principles

By embracing the following principles, guidelines, and actions to
follow or avoid, you will help us make the OMF community welcoming
and productive.

- **Be friendly and patient.**

- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and
  supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes,
  but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture,
  national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic
  class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity
  and expression, age, physical appearance, family status,
  technological or professional choices, academic discipline, religion,
  mental ability, and physical ability.

- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you
  in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will
  affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences
  into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide
  community. You may be communicating with someone with a different
  primary language or cultural background.

- **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but
  disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We might
  all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
  frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember
  that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not
  a productive one.

- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Be kind to others. Do not
  insult or put down other community members. Harassment and other
  exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not
  limited to:
    - Violent threats or violent language directed against another
      person
    - Discriminatory jokes and language
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material
    - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally
      identifying information ("doxing")
    - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms
    - Unwelcome sexual attention
    - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
    - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
      stop, then stop

- **Moderate your expectations.** Please respect that community members
  choose how they spend their time in the project. A thoughtful question
  about your expectations is preferable to demands for another person's
  time.

- **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both
  social and technical, happen all the time and the OMF community is no
  exception. Try to understand where others are coming from, as seeing
  a question from their viewpoint may help find a new path forward. And
  don’t forget that it is human to err: blaming each other doesn’t get
  us anywhere, while we can learn from mistakes to find better
  solutions.

- **A simple apology can go a long way.** It can often de-escalate a
  situation, and telling someone that you are sorry is an act of empathy
  that doesn’t automatically imply an admission of guilt.

## Reporting

As a member of our community, you are also a steward of these values.
Not all problems need to be resolved via formal processes, and often a
quick, friendly but clear word in an online message or in person can
help resolve a misunderstanding and de-escalate things.

An informal enforcement of this process may be inadequate if there is
urgency, risk to someone, no one is comfortable speaking out, the
offender is unresponsive, etc. In that case, please file a report
by emailing [Heather Turnbull](mailto:hturnbull@gmggroup.org),
the Operations Manager at GMG. Reports will be kept anonymous and action
will be taken.

## Antitrust Compliance

All participants in GMG activity must comply with applicable
antitrust laws. Please refer to the detailed guidelines provided on the
[GMG governance page](https://gmggroup.org/about-us/governance/).
